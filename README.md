## music-simulator
a xylophone app to simulate musical notes using particles

A basic, clean, intuitive UI, with a fountain of particles at the center of the page, changing behaviour and color with user interaction. The xylophone uses the second row of 12 keys ('Q' key to ']' key) on a keyboard. Each note has a dedicated color to match it. 'follow mouse' checkbox to make the particles follow the user's mouse, making the experience more interactive.

Enjoy playing around :)
